                        <p>The Dzüko Valley is a valley located in borders of the state of Nagaland and Manipur in the
                            Southern Angami region of northeast India. This valley is well known for its natural
                            environment, seasonal flowers and flora and fauna. It is situated at an altitude of 2452 m
                            above sea level.Also known as the Valley of Flowers, the Dzukou Valley is one of the most
                            visited tourist attractions in the North East.it is considered to be one of the most famous
                            adventure spots in Kohima, Nagaland.
                            <br>In summer, vivid green hillocks pave the way for blue mountaintops, and bright flowers
                            wave in the winds amongst the tall grasses. In winter, temperatures drop far lower than one
                            would expect in such tropical states, and Dzukou Valley freezes, sometimes covered in white
                            snow.It’s a beautiful place to hike around in itself, flowers or not, and if you’re into
                            rock climbing there are plenty of opportunities to break a sweat within the valley.

                            painting... Majestic white waves rushing to wipe out the feet imprints left by you on the
                            white sand while the wind continues to flirt with the palm trees.Goa's Baga beach is a small
                            but perfect beach located between its two more famous cousins, Anjuna on one side and
                            Calangute on the other. It is a good place to enjoy some quite moments and dwell in peaceful

                        <p>Chandipur, is a beach in Baleswar District, Odisha, India. The beach is located on the shore
                            of Bay of Bengal and is approximately 16 kilometers from the Baleswar Railway Station. The
                            beach is unique in a way that the water recedes up to 5 kilometers during the ebb tide. Due
                            to its unique circumstances, the beach supports bio-diversity. Horseshoe crab is also found
                            here on the beach towards Mirzapur, the nearby fishing market and community at the
                            confluence of the Budhabalanga River (Balaramgadi). It is a suitable picnic spot. One of
                            Odisha Tourism's Panthanivas (guest house) is situated here.</p>
